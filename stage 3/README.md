# Stage 3 - Task Management API

Welcome to Stage 3 of Kodecamp 4.0! This folder contains the backend implementation and API tests for the Task Management API.

## Contents

- `tests/`: Directory containing HTTPie tests for interacting with the APIs.
- `index.js`: Main server file that creates and configures the API endpoints.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Dependency files for Node.js packages.

## Getting Started

To get the API up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `stage 3/` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs all required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

2. **Run the Server**: Start the server by running:
   ```
   npm run server
   ```
   This command launches the server and makes the APIs available for testing and development.

## API Tests

- Use the `tests/` directory for HTTPie tests to interact with the APIs.
- Modify and extend the tests as needed to cover all API endpoints and scenarios.

## Additional Information

- Ensure Node.js (version specified in `package.json`) is installed on your system.
- Customize the API endpoints and functionality in `index.js` as per project requirements.
